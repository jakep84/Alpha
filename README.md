Refugee Story

Mei is a refugee from Burma, Mianmar. She is nineteen years old. 
Due to political unrest in her home country along with her family she had to flee to the U.S.
Everything and everyone that she knows was left behind. She is now forced to re-start. A reset button was pushed on her life, per se, but her past memories continued to linger. Either way life continued moving forward.
She has a range of opportunities on her hands in this new country but whether or not she will actually be able to take advantage of them will depend on how quickly she adapts to her new environment.
Amongst other challenges, she needs to understand how to effectively communicate in the new language and move around. There are volunteers that will help overcome challenges like such in this journey. However, in order to help both Mei and the volunteers, the Alpha app was created.
The app will allow volunteers to invite Mei and people in a similar condition to do social activities (to kill the isolation). As they work on these activities, they also improve their language skills. The volunteers also provide guidance for the transition from collectivist to an individualistic culture.
Mei feels safe to request help thru Alpha. As developers, we hope that Mei's future is brighter than her past ; therefore we are proud to be a part of such a positive change.
Our app can be helpful for any foreign born individuals present in the U.S. at any point in time (international students and scholars, refugees, turists and so on).
